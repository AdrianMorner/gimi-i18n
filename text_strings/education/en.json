  "save_chapter_1_intro": "Going cheaper may seem like a negligible savings strategy, but when applied to everyday items it can amount to a fortune over time. A common challenge we face when going cheaper is making trade-offs between price and quality. You may be able to save £50 a year by switching to a cheaper toilet paper. But it may also mean that you need to lower your standards in terms of quality. Or does it? And is it worth it?",
