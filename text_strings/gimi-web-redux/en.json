  "terms.terms": "Introduction\nWe are Gimi AB, a company organised under the laws of Sweden (hereinafter ‚ÄúGimi‚Äù, ‚ÄúUs‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe‚Äù, ‚ÄúOur‚Äù, etc.).\nThese Terms of Service (the ‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) apply between Gimi and you regarding your access and use of the Service (as further described below). It is important that you read the Terms very carefully before accessing or using the Service, since these Terms set out the responsibilities between you and Gimi. \nBy registering as a user with Gimi and accessing and using the Service you agree to be legally bound by the Terms. If you don‚Äôt agree with these Terms and if you don‚Äôt wish to be bound by them, you may not access or use the Service.\nAs Gimi provides a global Service, specific Terms may apply in certain jurisdictions. This version of the Terms shall apply unless there is a local version of the Terms in your country. If there is a local version of the Terms, the local version shall apply instead.\n\nAbout the Service\nGimi provides a digital online tool intended to be used by children and parents to manage money, to help the family to handle the children‚Äôs economy and to educate children about money. (the \"Service\"). \nThe Service is made available through Our website (www.gimitheapp.com)(the \"Website\", ‚Äúour site‚Äù) and through Our application for mobile devices (the \"Application\"), both of which are designed for the whole family, including parents and young children under parent permission and supervision.\n\nParents‚Äô and children‚Äôs use of the Service\nIn order to use the Service you must be at least 18 years old or, if you are under 18 years old, have your parent or guardian's consent.\nIf you, as a parent or guardian, allow your child to use the Service you should ensure that your child is aware of how they may use the Service. You are responsible for all use carried out by any child under parental responsibility. We encourage that you frequently talk to your child regarding their use of the Service.\nOnly parents/guardians can sign up to the Service and connect accounts of the children under their care and custody. By signing up to the Service, as a parent or guardian, and connecting your child‚Äôs account, you allow and consent to your child‚Äôs use of the Service. A child‚Äôs account which is not connected to an account belonging to their parent or guardian within seven days will be deleted.\n\nYour responsibilities when using the Service\nTo get access to the Service you must accept and agree to the Terms and create a user account by registering certain personal data (including but not limited to name, phone-number, country etc.) (\"User Account\").\nYou are responsible for using the Service in a legal and responsible way in compliance with these Terms. Your use of the Service must therefore take into account the following responsibilities:\nYou are responsible for submitting complete, true and correct contact, account and payment information and for making sure such information is kept up to date. You are also responsible for ensuring that other information that you may transfer to Gimi as a User of the Service, to the best of your knowledge, is not false or otherwise may corrupt or disrupt the Service and that you have the right to share it with Gimi and other Users.\nYou are responsible for all use of the Service that occurs under your username. If your username, password, phone-number or the device you are using to access the Service become lost or stolen or if you have any reason to believe that there has been unauthorized access to your User Account, please notify Gimi immediately and change your password as soon as possible.\nYou may not use the Service for any commercial purposes or for any other purposes not related to the purpose of the Service (i.e to be used by children, parents/legal guardians and other adults approved by the parent/legal guardian to manage money and to help the family to handle their children‚Äôs economy and educate children about digital money).\nYou may not copy (except as expressly permitted by these Terms), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code, modify, or create derivative works of the Service, any updates, or any part thereof. Scraping of any information contained in the Service, including any third party information accessible via the Service, is strictly prohibited.\nThe Service may not be used in any way, which is illegal, harmful or may be considered offensive by Gimi, other Users or third parties. In particular, you may not use our Service in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party. Gimi is not responsible for any such use by any other user or party, but Gimi encourages you to report any incidents to Gimi (such as harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive or illegal messages).\nIf you break any of these terms and conditions, or if liabilities are incurred as a result of your use of the Service, you will be responsible for the costs and expenses, including legal fees, that we, or our employees, officers, directors or agents incur as a result. This will include any costs that result if someone else uses your personal information, or your Gimi account, unless you can prove that it has been used fraudulently.\n\nPersonal Data and Privacy\nWe take your privacy very seriously. We therefore apply the necessary security to your personal data and will only handle your personal information in accordance with our <a href=\"www.gimitheapp.com/terms\">Privacy Policy</a>.\n\nTermination or Suspension of the Service\nYou may terminate your agreement with Gimi at any time by uninstalling the Gimi Apps and ceasing the use of the Service.\nGimi may terminate the agreement with you, under these Terms, and suspend or terminate your use of and access to the Service if any of the following occurs:\nYou breach our terms and conditions\nYou fail to make a payment to us that is due\nYou fail to provide, when asked, information to allow us to check your identity or the validity of any information you have given us\nWe suspect you have been or are engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity when using the Service.\nUpon termination of your agreement with us, you must stop using the Service. If a termination is due to your breach of these Terms, you will not be refunded any fees paid, if any. \nGimi also has the right to terminate the agreement with you without giving any reason thereto. Upon such termination by Gimi without cause, you will be refunded any pre-paid fees.\n\nProprietary Rights\nThe Service is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. Gimi and its licensors shall retain ownership in and to the Service and to all related intellectual property rights, including without limitation trademarks, trade names, database rights and patents. You are granted a license with only a limited right to use the Service as set out in and subject to these Terms.\nThe license does not allow you to use Gimi‚Äôs name, trademarks or other commercial symbols. All rights and licenses not expressly granted to you under these Terms shall be retained by Gimi.\n\nLimitation of Liability\nWe can't guarantee that your access to our site, or its content, will be delivered uninterrupted or error-free, or that the site will be free from viruses or other harmful properties. It is your responsibility to put in place satisfactory safeguards and procedures to make sure that any material you obtain through our site is free from contaminations or other harmful properties.\nGimi controls and monitors content made available by the Users or any other third parties via the Service, but can nevertheless not guarantee its origin and correctness. Gimi is not responsible or liable for the validity and correctness of the content provided through and in connection with use of the Service. Any use of the information obtained through the use of the Service shall be done at your own discretion and risk.\nWe have taken every measure we can to prevent internet fraud and to ensure that any data collected from you is kept safe and secure. However, in the extremely unlikely event of a breach in our secure computer servers, we cannot be held liable.\nUnder no circumstances will we be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental or other kind of loss or injury resulting from your use, or downloading of any content from the Service.\nGimi is not responsible for delays or loss due to circumstances that we have no control over and which significantly impedes the fulfilment of the obligation in question or that causes the fulfilment of the obligation not being economically justifiable.\n\nTransfer or assignment\nGimi may assign and transfer the rights and duties under these Terms to any third party that Gimi co-operates with. Gimi will notify you of any such transfer or assignment if this affects your rights under these Terms.\n\nSupport and feedback\nGimi strives to provide adequate and efficient technical support, upgrades and updates for the Service. Gimi shall not, however, be under any obligation to provide support or maintenance for the Service under these Terms and reserves the right to limit the support, upgrades and updates provided from time to time.\nIf you post questions for our support experts or messages on our blogs or forums, you own the copyright to this text.

Please also note that you may always choose not to share Contact Information with Gimi and if you have shared information and changed your mind, you can easily delist your number or opt out to render your entire Contact Information unavailable for search in the database.\n\nOpt-in/registration\nWith the Gimi apps you are provided with a fast and smart signup process for your phone that, among other features, will provide instant search results from your phonebook.

Gimi will always require these parties to take appropriate organisational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation.\n\nThe following is a description of how Gimi may share information about you with trusted third party partners:\nGimi uses a third party partner company in order to send you or a third party you wish to contact SMS messages when you use the Service. In order to send you an SMS; we send the third party company your and the relevant third party‚Äôs phone numbers for the transmission of the requested SMS.\nGimi uses a third party partner company in order to send you or a third party you wish to contact e-mails when you use the Service. In order to send you an e-mail; we send the third party company your and the relevant third party‚Äôs e-mail address for the transmission of the requested e-mail.\nGimi may use Push Notification Service to notify you about updates and important information. In such cases, your phone number may be part of the notification. This message is sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to your device. You may, however, at any time opt out or disable push notifications.\nGimi may allow you to use third party services to create your user profile or log in to use our Service, share information with such third parties, or to connect your user profile with the respective third parties. Those third parties may automatically provide us with access to certain personal information retained by them about you (e.g. content viewed by you, content liked by you and information about the advertisements you have been shown or may have clicked on). You control the personal information you allow us to have access to through the privacy settings on the respective third party service and the permissions you give us when you grant us access to the personal information about you retained by the respective third party service. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Gimi user profile and authorising us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use and retain the information provided by these third party services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. As an example, Gimi may send a queried telephone number to Twitter in order to verify it against the Twitter API or retrieve the holder‚Äôs Twitter ID or Twitter photo, if available. If the Twitter ID is available, Gimi will display a Tweet and follow button in the User‚Äôs Gimi apps, which the User may use to send an open tweet to, and start to follow, the holder of the number. The Gimi apps are not, however, designed to be Twitter communication applications and you will not be able to retrieve the replied or further tweets to the Gimi apps. When using the Twitter functionalities you are bound by the Twitter Terms of Service, located at https://twitter.com/tos, and the Twitter privacy policy, located at https://twitter.com/privacy.\nFor the provision of free versions of the Service, Gimi may also collaborate with a few selected third party advertising networks, which in such case may be provided limited information related to the freemium User‚Äôs device (but no other User or Contact Information).\nGimi, or a third party on its behalf, may collect and use your email address, telephone number and ID for advertising (including, but not limited to, content viewed by you, content you have commented on and information about the advertisements you have been shown or may have clicked on) through the Gimi apps and website and share this information with third party advertisers and networks.

You can limit or opt out of the collection and use of your information for ad targeting by third parties via your device settings.\nThe submission of Contact Information by you and the processing thereof by Gimi is  protected under the applicable law, see the Gimi Terms of Service. Gimi may, however, disclose information contained in the Service and about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary, always provided, of course, it is also lawful.\nGimi may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences from using the Gimi Service, which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback forms or any surveys that you accept to take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Gimi software, products and websites.\n\nCookies and Automatically collected information\nThe Gimi Website uses ‚ÄúCookies‚Äù in connection with the Service.
